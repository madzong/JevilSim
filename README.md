Simulators for the Jevil and Spamton NEO bosses from DELTARUNE. This repository contains only the launcher that I have created, but the actual simulator is just modded DELTARUNE. DELTARUNE was created by Toby Fox; I do not claim anything, that has to do with the game.

# Jevil Simulator
## Featuring
### Multiple game modes!
 * Normal - what do you expect?
 * Hard - jevil gets a bit more hp and his damage is increased by 1,5x
 * NoHit - if you get hit you die irl
 * Chaos - find out for yourself (if you manage beat this... well i don't care)
 * SpeedUp - the game is sped up just a bit
